# Introduction

## What is Rasberry Pi?

The Raspberry Pi is an tiny computer, that includes a tiny processor, a bit of memory, a slot for an SD card, and some input/output jacks, e.g. HDMI, USB, headphone, camera, and pin header for various sensors.

## Why use Raspberry Pi?

The Pi has a lot of functionality and flexibility for develop monitoring of environmental parameters. 

## Uses in Environmental Science

### Air Pollution Monitoring

### Soil Water Monitoring and Irrigation Control

### Conservation 

Conservation biologists use a wide range of instruments to track and monitor wildlife (camera traps, active (radio) and passive (RIF) transmitters). In addition the use of cameras are used to evaluate plant health and diversity (spectral analysis).
