### Drone Dojo's "Raspberry Pi Drone - a Complete Drone Kit"

Link: https://dojofordrones.com/raspberry-pi-drone/

This source goes through building a drone around your Raspberry Pi (from scratch), but also details power sources and useful drone software.

- This guide uses velcro, zip ties, and double-sided tape to attach hardware to the frame

- What is our drone's thrust to weight ratio? How would the addition of the Raspberry Pi change that?

- Things like Ardupilot build Linux-based flight controllers... but we already have a remote control for our drone.  Potentially could look into this to develop self-piloted drone (using a stepwise method to move along pollutant gradients?)

- This website also has a "drone programming primer" (https://dojofordrones.teachable.com/p/drone-programming-primer-for-software-development) that is a 99 USD course; just good to know about.

### Drone Dojo's "Open Source Drone Software Projects"

Link: https://dojofordrones.com/open-source-drone/

This source gives background on Ardupilot and PDX, the two most prevalent open sources for drone code.

- Ardupilot was originally developed for Arduino (but seems to have expanded beyond) which means it is definitely compatible with the Pi, just may take some fanagaling

- PX4 is part of the Linux Foundation and provides an operating system upon which to build drone code

- PX4 doesn't require you to push your code back to the source, so it's more compatible for intellectual property than Ardupilot is

- Ardupilot started in Dronecode (which is the project PX4 is a part of) but then went renegade; as a result, PX4 is better funded

- Both Ardupilot and PX4 are useful for autonomous drones

- Betaflight is largely a quadracopter code source for remote-controlled quadracopters (!!! this might be the best option for us until we reach a point where we want to go autonomous)

- Betaflight is "supported on any autopilot hardware board using at least a STM32F3 processor"

- Librepilot and Cleanflight are other options similar to Betaflight

### Drone Dojo's "ArduPilot Introduction"

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLgiealSjeVyx3t4N9GroE29SbVwhYrOtL&v=jfP71egUpg8

This video specifically talks about ArduPilot, but is part of a playlist that goes into all sorts of information about programming drones that may be relevant to us later.

Once again, Ardupilot is more autonomous than it is remote-controlled, but this could be cool further down the line.

### Instructable's "Drone Pi"

Link: https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Drone-Pi/

This is the details of a project done by students in France. Definitely has a school project vibe, but goes into the process of building a drone.  Again, this isn't quite what we're doing, but it does describe the way that they mount the Pi, as well as how they get the drone connected to Wifi.

- They use a mounting pad (link is unfortunately broken), Wifi key, and a USB key to save their data (which is a video... I think our Pi would be able to store sensor sample measurements in CSV form without a USB)

- Use an "anti-vibration pad"? What is this?

- They set up their programs to automate at boot with crontab -e, which I tried and it didn't work for me.  Why?

### Device Plus' "DIY Raspberry Pi Drone Mechanics"

Link: https://www.deviceplus.com/raspberry-pi/diy-raspberry-pi-drone-mechanics-part-1/

- These people use a wifi dongle, and also (interestingly) use a suction-cup cell phone holder for a car to attach their phone to their controller, but this seems like it might also work for the Pi?

- They attach the Pi itself with hot glue, which does not seem conducive to removing the Pi at any given point.  So far, I like the velcro on the anti-vibration pad the best.

### Thingiverse's "Flamewheel f450 Anti-Vibration Raspberry Pi 3 and Navio 2 Mount"

Link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2083427 

These people made their own anti-vibration mount to connect their Pi to a drone.
