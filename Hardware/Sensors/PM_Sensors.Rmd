# Our sensor

We are using a Digital Particle Concentration Laser Sensor PMS5003 PM2.5 PM10+Cable for Arduino from Amazon, which costs 38.75 USD.  This sensor comes with eight female-to-female connectors as well as an adapter for Arduino or Raspberry Pi, and a connector for the Raspberry Pi and the adapter itself.  

## Helpful resource

The guide below was compiled from an instructional Youtube video published on 11 January 2019 by Chengyi Wu.  While the video is not in English, it is easy to follow along both with the physical construction and code for the PMS5003:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0bzyEnjZY4 

# Physically connecting the sensor to Raspberry Pi

1.  Begin by connecting the sensor to the adapter. Take the colorful wires with white blocks on either end and attach them to both the sensor and the small adapter; they attach with the "shiny" side up, and you need to give them quite a push to get them to go in fully.  They should be snug, and not at all loose.

2.  Next, connect the adapter to the Raspberry Pi.  Separate four of the female-to-female connectors (the ones with the black rectangles on either end) and attach one of the ends to the TXD, RXD, GND and VCO terminals on the adapter (these correspond to the 4th, 5th, 7th, and 8th terminals from the top).  

* Connect the wire attached to the VCC terminal to node 2 on the Raspberry Pi.

* Connect the wire attached to the GND terminal to node 9 on the Raspberry Pi.

* Connect the wire attached to the RXD terminal to node 8 on the Raspberry Pi. 

* Connect the wire attached to the TXD terminal to node 10 on the Raspberry Pi.

3.  Connect your Pi to power, and your sensor is good to go!


# Coding the PM10 sensor into Raspberry Pi

I did this entire step within the Raspberry Pi terminal interface.  

## Preliminary steps

1.  Enter "sudo raspi-config".

2.  Select option 5 ("Interfacing Options").

3. Enable ARM I2C by selecting it in this menu and then pressing Yes.

4. Then to enable Serial, choose Serial on the menu. 

5. A window will pop up asking, "would you like a login shell to be accessible over serial?", and the answer is NO.

3.  Next, a window will pop up asking, "Would you like the serial port hardware to be enabled?", this time say YES, and exit the window.

5. Click Finish, you may be prompted to reboot, and select YES. 

## Code

We have made the code available on Sakai, so you can download it directly from the web onto your Pi or follow the steps below:

1 Open up a text document in nano by typing "nano pms5003.py" into the bar in the terminal (pms5003.py will be our document name).

2  Copy the following code to your computer's clipboard using Ctrl C:

```{python, eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
import serial # These are the pre-coded Github packages that this code uses; serial allows python to run on different back-end connections.
from collections import OrderedDict # Imports the ordered dictionary function
import csv # Package that allows you to compile to a csv file
import time # Allows you to define time intervals

class Sensor(): # Defining what you are gathering data from
  def __init__(self, tty = '/dev/ttyS0'): # Signals that you are getting data from GPIO pins
    self.tty = tty
  
  def open(self): # Opening the connection between the sensor and the Pi
    self.serial = serial.Serial(self.tty, baudrate = 9600) # Baudrate is the signal rate between the sensor and Pi
  
  def close(self): # Closing the connection between the sensor and the Pi
    self.serial.close()
    
  def read_bytes(self, data, idx, size = 2): # Translates data from sensor to Pi
    return int("".join(data[idx : idx + size]), 16)
    
  def read(self): # Translates data from Pi to output
    data = self.serial.read(32)
    data = ["{:02X}".format(d) for d in data]
    
    if data[0] != '42' or data[1] != '4D':
      return None
      
    res = OrderedDict() # This code returns an ordered dictionary of the following elements:
    res['pm1_cf'] = self.read_bytes(data, 4)
    res['pm25_cf'] = self.read_bytes(data, 6)
    res['pm10_cf'] = self.read_bytes(data, 8)
    res['pm1'] = self.read_bytes(data, 10)
    res['pm25'] = self.read_bytes(data, 12)
    res['pm10'] = self.read_bytes(data, 14)

    res['temperature'] = self.read_bytes(data, 24) / 10
    res['humidity'] = self.read_bytes(data, 26) / 10
    return res
    
def  write_to_csv(): # Writes the output to a csv file
        if __name__ == "__main__":
                with open('/home/pi/pms5003_data.csv', mode='a') as csv_file: # First condition is the name and location of your csv file (this can be changed); second condition is the 'append' mode, which allows you to add new lines to the document without overwriting old ones
                        csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
                        csv_writer.writerow([data]) # Data is what your output is titled
                with open('/home/pi/pms5003_data.csv', mode='r') as csv_file: # Now that your csv file is appended, this allows you to read it and actually prints the output
                        csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
                        for row in csv_reader:
                                print(row)
               
if __name__ == '__main__': # This denotes the path that your code follows.  These all use the conditions that you defined in the code above.
  while True: # Creates a loop so that the code will read in intervals as defined below.
    '''
    Test code
    '''
    sensor = Sensor() # Defining the sensor as above
    sensor.open() # Opening the sensor
    data = sensor.read() # Reading data from the sensor
    sensor.close() # Closing the sensor
    print(data) # Printing the data to the terminal
    write_to_csv() # Compiling the data to a CSV file
    time.sleep(10) # Establishing that the data will be read in ten second intervals (can be changed).
  
```


A few notes on this Python code:

- Pay very close attention to spacing and indentations! This is very, very important in Python.  The code will not run if the indentations are at all off.
- This code will automatically create a csv file under the title "pms5003_data.csv".  You can access this document in your Pi's File Explorer under "Pi".  
- When you go to open the csv file that the data stores to, select the following viewing settings for the most user-friendly experience:  tab, comma, trim spaces, and other (within the text box for other, type ")").  This will separate the actual values from the titles; you can do the rest of the "beautifying" of the data in R.

3.  Re-enter the nano file you created above, and right click anywhere within the file to bring up a menu; select the "paste" option.  This should place the code above into the file without altering the spacing or indentations.

4.  Save the text document with ctrl o (it will ask it what you want to name it, you can leave it as pms5003.py), and then exit it with ctrl x.

5.  Now within the main shell, type "python3 pms5003.py". When I submitted the text, I got one of two responses -- some error, usually about some indentation problem that took way too long to sort out OR it seem to quietly be in standby mode. I think it was sending the program to my Pi, perhaps compiling and sending the commands to the sensor.  

It should release a reading of the different measurements specified at intervals of ten seconds, and compile the data into a CSV file.

# Still to come

- Checking for accuracy (why divide the temperature/humidity by ten?)

- "The Raspberry Pi does not have a Real-Time Clock: on bootstrap it gets the time via NTP protocol over the internet. If an NTP server is not available, it will default to the time of last shutdown. Neverthless the station is supposed to work and store data even when there is not internet connection, so it is required a Real-Time Clock module." -> do we need one of these?
